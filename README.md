# hello-world
This is my first git repository

This is a bit about me. I'm a project manager that want's to do a little bit of coding to get my head back into what the developers are
 doing at work to help me make sore sense of their estimates.
 
 The first thinkg I will do is create a project in Visual Basic, then I'll try to recreate the program with Java.
 
 good luck me!
